title: "You can kinda invent your own weird design language with attributes and attribute selectors"

> In CSS, attribute selectors have some fairly powerful matching abilities. You can match any attribute and any attribute with exact values, values that start with certain text, contain certain text, end with certain text, etc. This allows you to get pretty weird with a styling "language" if you want to.

I still contend that my `box=":emoji:"` is the future.
