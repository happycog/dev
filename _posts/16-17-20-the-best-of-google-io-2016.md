One of the best I/O write ups I've read so far.

> Serviceworker step by step, CSS containment, credentials and payment APIs, animation techniques, devtools improvements… Google I/O dropped so much web content this year I took a full month to catch up with even a fraction of it. If anything this shows just how fast the web is flying today. I put together some highlights.

Andrew sums it up nicely too,

> On the one hand, the web now has so many APIs that it’s hard for one person to ever even be aware of all of them.

Most of these are half baked previews or drafts though, so I wouldn't fault anyone for skimming most of these. They also seems overly targeted at recreating a native experience in the browser. What I'd love to see is a recommendation for using service workers on less app-y site, like apple.com, for example.
