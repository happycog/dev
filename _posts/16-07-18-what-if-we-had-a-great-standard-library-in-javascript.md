title: "What if we had a great standard library in JavaScript?"
---

Most of the time I actually enjoy writing code in Javascript. However, when an `npm install` goes awray, that's when I start pulling out my hair.

> Many of the packages on NPM are literally one-liners. Why would people include a one-line-of-code library in their projects and not just write it themselves? Is it lazyness? I don’t think so—it’s more of a convention in the JavaScript world that everything should be compartmentalized, filed away in neat little modules and all held together by some dependency pyramid scheme.

This is the root of my issue with Javascript. There are so many small packages, imitating functionality that should be built into the language, that when one of those packages goes belly up it can ruin _everything_. There's a fine line to walk between bloating the language v. completing the language. I don't know that Javascript needs _all the things_, but some of the [recent additions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get) certainly help.
