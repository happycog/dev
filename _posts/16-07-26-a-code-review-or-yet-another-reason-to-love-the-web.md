> One of the things Snook touched on was that he typically doesn’t prefer to mark things up before having any designs in place. I can certainly appreciate this sentiment, as it’s tough to know how things should be structured without knowing what the end goal is.

> But! I’m a massive fan of getting into the browser on Day One of a project, and I feel that frontend developers can and should play the role of prep chef. Rather than coming in *after* many (often bad/limiting) design decisions have already been made, developers have a huge opportunity to establish UI pattern markup and crude CSS upfront so they can spend more time collaborating *with* the project’s designers to create the design system. Doing this prep chef work gets designs into the browser — the project’s final environment — as quickly as possible so the team can address essential aspects of design like responsiveness, performance, true type and color rendering, ergonomics, and much more.

This analogy clearly communicates how tightly the front-end roll is coupled to the designer's roll as chef.

This analogy also smartly shifts the focus of why the front-end roll is getting started sooner than in a traditional waterfall process. Getting started early isn't about writing production code on day one. Rather it is a chance to assemble the pieces ahead of time, pre chopping the onions, so when it's time all that's left is assembly.
